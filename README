Sample Android Project
Flicki = Flickr Search Application

Searches for public photos on Flickr for any given query. This is intended to view any specific user's images. Its meant for leisure viewing of public Flickr photos which I like to do a lot!

To Use:
Download APK (in downloads) and install.
Start app and search away

Features
I have tried a different presentation of search results here.
There are 4 rows of results that are flickable (Android Gallery objects)
Clicking on the thumbnail opens the full image.
Click on the name here to go to the Flickr page.

Techniques
Lazy loading of results - First only top 20 image results are retrieved from Flickr. As the user starts browsing, Asynchronous tasks retrieve more results.

The thumbnails are in a gallery - that lazy loads the thumbnail only when the user flicks.

Improvements
Some images fail to download. I have added a retry option that makes 3 attempts to download the image. Need to figure out the right way.

Need to download the next few thumbnails before the user flicks.
